# ADC-Module
This is a milestone for my goal to be an embedded software engineer. ADC is incredibly important for all of the sensors.
I've had the board respond to a variable resistor(I can add any kind of sensor on it) to change the color of the LEDs. 
This for me is a great proof of concept of making a obstacle avoid robot with a sonar sensor or an infared sensor infront.
